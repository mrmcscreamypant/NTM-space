## Added
* Mun cows! These rare cows are found on the Mun, they moonwalk and drop cheese. Directly inspired by the 2023 April Fools update
* Basic atmospheric chemistry
    * Currently just water table chem, adding 0.2atm of water vapor (steam) to an atmosphere will allow infinite water tanks to function

## Changed
* Infinite water tanks now check the water table of the celestial body you're on, rather than atmospheric pressure
    * It was confusing everyone, since most players assumed they could just increase the air pressure of the room they're in to make them function

## Fixed
* Missing biome ID configs
* Mun was called Moon in some places
* Remove future biomes (they'll be back in the WAR update)
* No more cascading issues for atmosphere blobs (pressurised rooms should always report correct pressure now)
* Stations now play space music instead of overworld music
* Remove duck spawning
* Fix scutterblood coker recipe
